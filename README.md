# hack-the-valley-4-DigitalU
For Hack the valley 4 my team and I created a fun Whatsapp Bot that talks on your behalf. It can be used by someone who is extremely busy but still wants to keep in touch with his/her contacts.
 
## motivation
The motivation behind this was the posibility of having a computer keep in touch with someone while you have an exam due. This could be really helpful in some ways but again I wouldnt want to keep talking to a machine, so this only meant to send a few messages to keep the person in loop and aware about you.

## limitations
Main limitations we faced were the issues in training the dataset in a very short amount of time and being able to create a different customized message for different people in your contact list. Because obviously you will chat differently with differnt people.

## tech/api used
* Training the data:
    * Python
    * Anaconda
    * Tensorflow<br/><br/>
    
    
* Building the windows app:
    * Javascript
    * Node.js
    * .json (to store the replies)
