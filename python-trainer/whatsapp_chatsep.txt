2 is  York University's largest multidisciplinary hackathon held at the heart of Lassonde where we aim to embark on a radically different way of learning, inviting 300+ changemakers from all across North America. 
 YorkU Hacks, we believe in the importance of combining our technological skills with social conscientiousness. To make any great impact in our society, we believe that technology cannot act alone. To design actual solutions, we need a generation of more than just "employees" and need to break free from the ordinary. We can turn these words to reality with your help.
inded students from other universities as well as our industrial partners. Our collaborative partnerships with leading companies like FDM and Qualcomm will help establish a long term connection with Lassonde and our students. As we are a 24h hackathon, we will also require volunteers to work with our team for the event and this will be a great opportunity for the incoming Lassonde students to get involved with clubs, events as well as break the ice.
Sids Arun: The main expenses for the event are logisitcal. The funding will be primarily used for food, transportation and swags for the attendees.
